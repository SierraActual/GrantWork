If anything is going wrong with the program, click the terminal icon at bottom
of screen (looks like black square with >_ inside) and press crtl+c. This
will exit program immediately!

Optional:
    - Open "VS Code" application
    - click the file icon in the top left (if necessary)
    - click open folder
    - navigate to the folder with your csv files and the program (/users/grantbarnes/Documents/GrantWork/)
    - open GUI_texter.py
    - edit any of the variables at the top as needed. Be careful with this and make sure you don't touch any other Code
    - save the file (command + s) and exit VS code

1. Ensure .csv file is loaded into folder (/Users/grantbarnes/Documents/GrantWork/)
    - Download the excel page you want to use from your google drive
    - Recommend making any edits you need on the drive before downloading
        (e.g. removing already sent names, combining datasets, etc.)
        - This will be harder to do once the file is already downloaded
    - Rename the now downloaded file to "GrantCSV.csv"
        - DONT FORGET TO MAKE IT .CSV THE FIRST TIME. IF YOU FORGET, REDOWNLOAD.
    - Move this file to the "GrantWork" folder and overwrite the old one if necessary
    

2. Close all windows except iMessage and a terminal (search for "terminal" and it will pop up)
    a. Also a good practice to close all background programs that could interfere

3. Open the terminal

5. Type "cd /Users/grantbarnes/Documents/GrantWork/" (or a different path if you moved this folder)
    a. (can copy and paste it; leave out quotation marks)

6. Type "python3 GUI_texter.py"
    a. (can copy and paste it; leave out quotation marks)
    b. This will start the texter program.

7. Follow on-screen prompts
